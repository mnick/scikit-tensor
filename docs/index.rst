scikit-tensor is a Python module for multilinear algebra and tensor factorizations. Currently, scikit-tensor supports basic tensor operations such as folding/unfolding, tensor-matrix and tensor-vector products as well as the following tensor factorizations:

 - Canonical / Parafac Decomposition
 - Tucker Decomposition
 - RESCAL
 - DEDICOM
 - INDSCAL

Moreover, all operations support dense and tensors.
